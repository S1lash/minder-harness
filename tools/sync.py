"""Keep the base in step across every surface it is opened from.

Mechanics only: report the state of the base and take the SAFE action for that state.
Judgement — whether to ask the person, and how to say it to them — lives in
rules/device-sync.md. This script never forces, never rebases, and never discards a side.

Modes
  session-start   Safe sync-in for a session opening: fast-forward only when the copy is
                  clean and strictly behind. Prints the state and the required next action;
                  always exits 0 so a session never fails to start because of it.
  status          Print the state. Changes nothing.
  pull            Explicit sync-in, including a merge when both sides moved.
  save "<why>"    Stage everything, record it, sync, and send it out.
  session-end     Last chance on a surface about to disappear. Silent when there is nothing to
                  save; always exits 0 so an ending session never fails because of it.
