"""Make the cross-platform clauses of `rules/cross-platform.md` executable.

A clause a person has to remember is a clause that holds until the day somebody is in a hurry, and
the faults it catches are invisible to whoever writes them: they only appear on a platform the
author does not have. Why this is a gate rather than a habit: `DECISIONS.md`.

**Scope is not a new concept.** Tier 1 is exactly what `.engine-manifest.yml` ships — `engine:` plus
`template:`. Nothing is labelled and nothing is decided here; the manifest already says which paths
reach machines nobody in this repository will ever see. A `template:` entry inside an `exclude:`
directory still ships (`update.py` seeds it onto every base), so `template:` wins: one manifest must
not mean two different things to the updater and to the gate.

**Rules match code, never prose.** Comments are stripped and markdown is read only inside fenced
blocks that name a language, so a document that *describes* a banned construct — and
`rules/cross-platform.md` lists every one of them — is never a finding.

Which string literals count as code differs by language, because the languages differ. Python goes
through the tokenizer, where a **triple-quoted** string is prose (a docstring, a help constant) and a
short literal is data the rules must see — `open(p, "rb")` is legitimate precisely because of what is
inside the quotes. A **shell** string is code: `"${name^^}"` still expands and `sh -c "sed -i ..."`
still runs. A **PowerShell** string is usually a message to a person, so the native-command clause
ignores it — an installer that tells someone to run `git push` is not calling git. The
hardcoded-path clause reads strings in every language, because a path is a string and nothing else.

**One escape, and it is loud.** An inline `portability-ok: <reason>` in a COMMENT on the offending
line or the line directly above it, with the reason mandatory. It has to be a comment: an escape
that a string literal or a line of prose can trigger by accident is the opposite of loud. There is
no allowlist file either — a second escape mechanism is a second place to look, and an exemption
nobody reads is how a rule quietly stops applying.

One directory is not scanned, and it is named rather than patterned: `tools/tests/`, whose fixtures
are wrong on purpose. This module is scanned like everything else, and the one line of it that
matches — the pattern for a hardcoded path — carries the ordinary escape. That is the mechanism
working, not an exception to it.
