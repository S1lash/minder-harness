"""The checks behind the author-side gate — one function per thing that can be wrong.

Separated from `tools/check_engine.py` for the reason every check here exists: a file that holds
both the questions and the machinery for asking them grows until neither half is readable, and
the questions are what an author actually maintains. This module answers "what would be wrong
with this engine"; the tool beside it answers "how does a person hear about it".

A check never prints and never exits. It reports through `fail`, which takes the same four
things every time — WHERE to look, WHAT is wrong, and WHY it costs something — so one place
decides how a failure reads and no check invents its own line format.
