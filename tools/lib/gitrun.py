"""The one way this engine runs git.

One helper, one contract. A copy per tool means the same failure is reported differently
depending on which tool meets it — one raising when git is missing, one letting the exception
escape, one discarding stderr — and a caller cannot know which behaviour it is getting without
reading the helper beside it.

`Result` is a named triple rather than a bare tuple so that `out` and `err` cannot be swapped by
position, and `ok()` is separate from `run()` because "git failed" and "git returned nothing" are
different facts: collapsing them lets a failed `status` read as a clean base.
