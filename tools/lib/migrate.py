"""Carry a change the engine cannot express by replacing a file.

Replacement covers the engine's own paths and retirement covers the ones it dropped. Neither may
touch the person's space — which is right, it is theirs — so an engine change that REQUIRES something
there to move needs a channel of its own. This is it.

Three properties decide the shape, and they are why this is not the ordered chain with a ledger
that comparable engines use:

- **Data, not code.** The updater replaces itself mid-run while the old copy is already in memory,
  so logic added to it takes effect one update late. The manifest is re-read from disk after the
  checkout, so a declaration takes effect in the same run it ships in.
- **Convergent, not sequential.** Every operation is idempotent by construction and re-runs on
  every update, so a base at any version — including one dark for a year — lands in the same
  state. A ledger would need a valid starting point that an old base has never had.
- **Refuses what it does not understand.** A verb from a newer engine reaching an older updater stops
  the run and says to update once more, rather than silently skipping a change the engine believes
  landed.

Syntax, one entry per line under `migrations:`:

    - move <from> -> <to>
    - move <from> -> <to> | what to tell the person about it
