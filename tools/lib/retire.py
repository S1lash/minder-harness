"""Remove the paths the manifest says the engine no longer owns.

An update copies what the engine HAS. It cannot express what the engine no longer
has: the updater walks the `engine:` list, and a path that is gone is simply
never walked — so it stays on the base forever. A removed command goes on being
discoverable, describing a contract nothing honours; a removed script goes on
being importable.

`retired:` is the missing half. The author lists a path once and every update
converges every base. This runs on each update rather than as a one-off, on
purpose: a one-off reaches only the bases that have not run it yet, while this
reaches a base at any version, including one that has been dark for months.

Two properties make it safe to run unattended:

- **It never leaves engine space.** A retired path falling under `exclude:` — the
  manifest's own enumeration of the person's space — is refused, and the refusal
  is an error rather than a skip, because a path in the wrong section is an
  authoring mistake that has to be seen.
- **It only deletes what the manifest names.** No globs, no inference from what
  the engine lacks. "Absent upstream" is equally the shape of a botched path list.
