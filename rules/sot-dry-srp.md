# Single Source of Truth (HARD RULE)

One fact — one place — one owner. Applies to ANY artifact: docs, a task, code, a knowledge note, a
mapping, a convention. Any project, any session.

- **SoT.** Each fact has one canonical place. Needed elsewhere → link, not a copy.
- **DRY.** Tempted to copy → link. A duplicate = two sources of truth that will diverge.
- **SRP.** Each module / document / section / skill has one responsibility and one owner. Don't smear
  responsibility across files.
Check before creating any artifact: "does this fact already live somewhere? am I linking or copying?".
Copying → stop, justify to the person. Conscious explicit exceptions allowed.

## The home of a fact — by the object it's about

> SRP for knowledge; the analogy is OOP. Other rules point here by this name, so it is a section and
> not a bullet.

A fact about the object lives in that object's home. A process / use-case artifact (how WE apply the
object) describes ITS OWN thing and **links** to the object's home — like an OOP client references
rather than copying internals. Three layers, always separate:

- **Object-in-itself** (how it's built) → its own home (durable subsystem → its knowledge home;
  external tool → its tool home).
- **Automation over the object** (a callable verb — script / wrapper) → its own catalog + narrative.
- **Process / use-case** (how we apply it) → a topic domain, **by link** to the object's home.

Anti-pattern: an external tool's field IDs / auth / API mechanics inside a process doc or skill
instead of a link to the tool's home.

**Where to put ANY fact — one question:** "about the object itself / our process with it / a
callable automation over it?" → **object's home** / **topic domain by link** / **tool**. Map of
homes → `knowledge/_index.md`; moving a fact → `doctrine/harness-edit-checklist.md`.

## Home boundary — the base vs a project

> The base is one repository and `projects/` lives inside it, so most facts have both homes on the
> same disk. A project the person deliberately moved to its own repository is the exception, and it
> is recorded as such in `projects/_index.md`.

Decide **scope** first, then nature. **Order matters — cross-cutting / general first, else the fact
settles inside one project and becomes invisible to the others:**

1. **A relation / contract BETWEEN projects** (even if it names one's code element) → **base**.
2. **Externally observable behaviour / role / contract of a component** → **base** cross-cutting home.
3. **A general practice applicable to MANY projects** → **base** engineering knowledge. ⚠️ dev-only ≠
   automatically the project. Test by applicability: "many projects — or specific to THIS one?" →
   many → base; this one → the project.
4. **Only about ONE project's code / implementation** (its code element, a dev trap in its code, a
   convention that holds only there) → **that project's own `.claude/`** under
   `projects/<name>/`, filed by the nature of the fact.
5. **Not clear** → **ask the person**. Don't guess.

**Home is by the nature of the fact, NOT where the session is open:** working inside a project but
the fact is cross-project → base; working in the base but the fact is about one project's internals
→ that project. A project that lives in its own repository and is not present in this session →
write to the base cross-cutting home with `<!-- internal, move to the project when present -->`.
