# What the engine owns, what the person owns

> A base is one repository holding two things at once: the engine (the shared standard, identical in
> every fork) and the person's own life. **Which path is which is declared in
> `.engine-manifest.yml` at the base root — that file is the source of truth and this one is not.**
> Read this before replacing anything wholesale, before putting a person's fact anywhere near an engine
> path, and before adding a path to either half.

## The five categories, and what each one means for you

The manifest's own header defines them precisely. What they oblige you to do:

- **engine** — the engine. An update replaces these wholesale. **Never write a person's fact here**;
  it survives exactly until the next update, and nothing will announce that it is gone.
- **template** — seeds. They ship under their live names and an update never touches them again.
  A file carrying both a spec the engine maintains and rows the person accumulates belongs here.
  Adding one to `engine:` instead is how a person loses their own index.
- **exclude** — the person's space, listed for readability. **The default for a path named nowhere
  is already "the person's"** — a path is the engine's only by being listed.
- **migrations** — a change replacement cannot express: a path in the PERSON's space that has to
  move. Declared as data because the updater replaces itself mid-run, so its own new code would
  take effect an update late while a declaration is re-read from disk in the same run. Each is
  idempotent and re-runs on every update, so a base at any version converges with no ledger.
  A verb an older updater does not know stops the run rather than being skipped.
- **retired** — what the engine dropped. Every update deletes these from every base. Adding a path
  here is how a removal actually reaches the people running it.

## The rules that follow

- **An update is a replacement, not a merge.** Nobody is ever asked to resolve an overlap in a
  file they did not write. That property is the whole reason the split exists, and it holds only
  while the two halves stay disjoint.
- **Never put a person's fact in an engine path.** Route it by `rules/sot-dry-srp.md`. The one personal
  file inside the engine half is `profile.md`, and it is a `template:` precisely so an update cannot
  reach it.
- **Never put engine content in a person path.** A copy of a rule under `knowledge/` is a second
  source of truth that no update will ever correct. This is why the engine's own decisions live in
  `DECISIONS.md` and the person's in `knowledge/decisions.md`: same genre, two owners, two files.
- **A `template:` file's engine-maintained half is frozen at the person's clone date.** An update
  creates one that is missing but never rewrites one that exists — that is what keeps their rows
  safe, and the price is that the engine half cannot change afterwards. Keep it to what will not need
  to; put anything that will into an engine file the template links to.
- **Move something in the person's space → declare it under `migrations:`, never do it in code.**
  A move is refused outright if either side is the engine's own space, or if it would land on
  something the person already has. What it cannot do is reshape content INSIDE their files —
  that is their writing, and an engine change needing it is the trigger to design that verb, not to
  improvise one (`KNOWN-LIMITS.md`).
- **Remove an engine path → list it under `retired:` in the same change.** A removal that is not
  retired never propagates: the updater copies what the engine HAS and cannot express what it no
  longer has, so the file sits on every base forever, offering a contract nothing honours.
  Retiring something the PERSON produced is not a sweep's decision — the updater refuses it
  outright, and rightly.
- **Add an engine path → list it under `engine:` in the same change.** An unlisted new file reaches
  nobody: it is not copied on update, and it is the person's by default.
- **Inside `.claude/`, the two halves sit side by side.** `.claude/commands/` and
  `.claude/settings.json` are the engine's and are replaced on update; `.claude/skills/` and
  `.claude/settings.local.json` are the person's and are never touched. Author a capability for
  this person under `.claude/skills/` — putting it in `.claude/commands/` loses it at the next
  update, silently.
- **Moving the engine itself is staged, never sudden.** Publish the new `engine_remote:` one release
  BEFORE the move: every update reconciles the remote to what the manifest declares, so by the
  time the old address stops answering, every base is already pointed at the new one. Move first
  and the repair ships only through the channel that is broken.
- **The engine has its own remote, never `origin`.** `origin` is the person's private copy of
  their base. A base set up from the engine keeps both, so an update has somewhere to come from and a
  save has somewhere to go, with no way to confuse the two.
- **`version:` in the manifest is the engine's version**, mirrored into `VERSION` and
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. All three move in the same edit, or the updater's own
  post-condition fails the next update it runs.

## Shipping a release

`main` of the engine's repository IS the release channel: every base points its engine remote
at it, and anything landing there reaches everyone on their next update. Nothing half-finished goes
to `main`.

Before shipping, run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests` and
`python3 tools/check_engine.py --authoring`. The tests cover the machinery, the gate covers the
declaration and — through `check_portability.py`, which it calls — the shape of every file that
leaves this repository. It fails on every mistake that would otherwise only surface on somebody
else's machine, where nobody can see it and they cannot diagnose it:

- a declared path that does not exist, or one owned by two sections at once;
- a file removed from inside an engine directory without a `retired:` line — git ADDS and UPDATES on
  checkout and never deletes, so without that line the file lives on every base forever;
- a retired path that still ships, or one listed on its own under `engine:` and retired in the
  same manifest — a path cannot both be shipped and dropped. Retiring a file from INSIDE a shipped
  directory is the ordinary case and always allowed;
- a path listed twice in one section, which raises the count an update reports without raising the
  work, so an author reads the higher number as their change landing;
- `engine_remote:` naming a repository that is not this one. Fork this repository and forget that line, and
  every base you set up is reconciled back to upstream on its first update;
- a tool in `tools/` declared nowhere, which therefore reaches nobody, or one that ships without a
  row in `tools/_engine.md` — an agent orients from that catalog, so a tool missing there is
  invisible in the one surface it exists for;
- an engine tool written in shell or PowerShell with no twin beside it. This is the fault the
  portability gate cannot see: a `.sh` of impeccably portable bash is still not runnable by
  PowerShell, and reading its contents will never say so;
- a rule missing from the one canon list, or that list restated in `CLAUDE.md`;
- a pointer into a named section that the target does not have. `rules/present-not-history.md`
  forbids citing a heading without opening it, and the same rule requires rewriting a document
  whole — so headings move, and nothing but a person's eyes otherwise stands between a moved one
  and a citation that points confidently at the wrong paragraph;
- engine paths changed without `VERSION` moving (nobody's daily check notices), or `VERSION` moved
  without `CHANGELOG.md` (the update has nothing to tell them);
- a shipped file that would behave differently on Windows or on macOS. `python3
  tools/check_portability.py --rules` prints what it looks for, from the rule table itself. This
  one is why the gate exists at all: those faults are invisible to the author by construction,
  because the author's machine is the one they work on.

The structural half of the same gate runs on any base and is what `/minder:doctor` calls, and so
do the tests: a base can prove its own machinery works without its owner knowing what any of it is.

A green test that cannot fail proves nothing. When you change any of this, break it on purpose and
watch the test catch it — that is how the one test guarding a real past bug was caught testing the
wrong shape of it, passing against the very mutation it existed to stop.
