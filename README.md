# Minder Harness

**A better base for working with your AI agent.** Clone it once and it becomes yours —
the agent runs the structure, you just talk and work. It ships with a canon of hard rules,
self-learning, knowledge that survives sessions, and a concierge stance, all in force from the
first minute: an operating standard, not a folder template.

- Solo, cross-agent (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor), domain-agnostic.
- One base that follows you — the same thing on your computer, in your terminal, and on your
  phone. Keeping those in step is the agent's job, not yours.
- Yours from the clone on. The engine half stays updatable — `/minder:update` replaces it and
  drops what the engine retired — and everything you and your agent write is never touched
  (`.engine-manifest.yml` draws the line).
- The structure is for the *agent*. You never file, sort, or organize anything.

## Quickstart (for a person)

1. **Clone it into a folder you name** — pick a place and a name you'll recognize; you'll
   launch your AI agent from there.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S1lash/minder-harness harness   # name it whatever you like
   ```
   On Windows, open a terminal (PowerShell) and run it from there, so the window stays open and
   you can read what it says.
2. **Tell your agent: "install this."** It asks a few plain questions — where, your
   language, which agents you use — sets up the one private place your base lives online, and
   wires everything up. Then you just work.

From then on it is one base: everything you build lives inside it, and the agent keeps your
computer and your phone showing the same thing — it saves as you go and asks before it does.

**On the phone**, open the same base from the Claude app or claude.ai/code and point it at the
private place set up in step 2. There is nothing else to install: the base carries its own wiring,
so an agent that can see the repository is already set up.

That's the whole onboarding. You don't need to understand the structure below — the agent
does.

## For the agent receiving "install this"

You have been handed this repository by a person who said **"install"** (or similar). Do the
setup for them — do not make them learn the structure. Steps:

1. **Read `AGENTS.md`** — the contract every runtime reads, and the one place the canon is
   listed. (Claude Code reaches it through `CLAUDE.md`, which is one import of it.) The canon in
   `rules/` is your standard and minimum quality bar; load it.
2. **Ask the questions yourself, or run the installer** — `./install.sh` (macOS / Linux /
   Git-Bash) or `install.ps1` (Windows). It reads answers from a terminal, so running it from your
   own shell means nobody is there to answer: it stops rather than taking defaults nobody chose.
   Walk its steps conversationally, or pass the person's answers on stdin with
   `MINDER_HARNESS_ANSWERS_ON_STDIN=1`. What it asks and what each answer buys them is written out step by
   step in `.claude/commands/minder/harness/init.md`, which is the procedure to follow.
3. **Create that private place if the installer could not** — it says so explicitly. Use your
   GitHub access to create a **private** repository, set it as `origin`, and send the base to it.
   This is also the first real test of that access: if you do not have it, say so plainly and say
   what it costs them, rather than leaving it half-done.
4. **Confirm** in plain language what you set up. Then work normally — you now own this
   structure: route facts to their homes, keep it healthy, grow it as the person works.
   Never push the structural burden back onto them.

New session later? `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` load the canon automatically; consult
`knowledge/_index.md` on demand and `activities/_index.md` only on narrow "we did / last
time / continue" signals — never load history by default. Every session opens by bringing the
base up to date and closes by offering to save it — `rules/device-sync.md` is the contract, and
you follow it whether or not the session-start hook ran.

## What's inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `rules/` | The canon — hard rules, loaded hot every session. Your standard. `AGENTS.md` lists them; that list is the only one. |
| `doctrine/` | On-demand authoring meta, read when a task needs it and never by default. `AGENTS.md` says what is in there. |
| `knowledge/` | Durable understanding. Ships empty with the routing & growth discipline. |
| `activities/` | Work that survives sessions. Agent-maintained index + strict anti-bias rule. |
| `projects/` | The things you build — **inside** the base, so they travel with it. Agent-maintained index. |
| `tools/` | Executable automation — what keeps your devices in step, what updates the engine half, and the tests that prove both still work. |
| `.claude/` | The session wiring: the catch-up hook and the engine's commands. |
| `plugins/frontend-crafter/` | Bundled: an anti-slop frontend-design skill, ready to use. |
| `profile.md` | The one personal file — *who you are*, grown carefully by the agent. Not a habit tracker. |
| `install.sh` · `install.ps1` | The conversational, cross-platform installer. |
| `AGENTS.md` | The contract every runtime reads — the canon list lives here and nowhere else. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | One import of `AGENTS.md` plus Claude-only notes. |
| `.engine-manifest.yml` | Which paths are the engine's and which are yours, what an update replaces, seeds, moves and drops. The one place that answers it. |
| `VERSION` | The engine version this base is on. |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Why the engine is built the way it is — what was chosen, what else was considered. |
| `KNOWN-LIMITS.md` | What the engine cannot do yet, stated plainly. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | How the pieces connect, and the invariants that hold it together. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | What changed between versions, read aloud to you by `/minder:update`. |
